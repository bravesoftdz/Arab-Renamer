+  Arab Renamer v 2.0
+  Descreption: Arab Renamer renames Arabic files to the same names but using
+  English characters like the word 'Quran', so that files could be used on
+  non-Arabic systems like Linux or on mp3 players, besides it can limit the
+  files names during renaming.
+  The program uses characters like 3, ', 6 and 7 which are popular characters
+  used to replace specific Arabic letters.
